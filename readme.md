# SDL_gpu bindings for beef

This repository contains bindings for all of
the SDL_gpu library a gpu accelerated drawing library for sdl.
Its also not activly updated and barely tested, it may work however you will need to check that for yourself

## Usage
This library requires the SDL2 2.0.22 which is currently
not distributed with beef, however just exchanging the old dll with the newer one seems to work fine and I
havent really found any issues (not saying that they dont exist)

The main library can be used via "Add Project"

There isnt really any documentation for the library so you will have to find this out yourself
or learn from the examples in the original library

## TODO
There are some things that might be missing or may be nice to do.  
If you want to help you can do these.  

-> Write Documentation for the library  
-> Add comments to the function bindings (some methods have comments that arent copied over)  
-> Check for functionality of the library  
-> Update the beef sdl bindings to 2.0.22
